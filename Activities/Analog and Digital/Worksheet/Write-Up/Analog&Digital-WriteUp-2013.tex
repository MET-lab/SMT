\section*{Analog \& Digital: The Wave Game}

\underline{\textit{Objective:}} \\
\doublespace
The objective of this game is for your team to draw the most accurate representation of a waveform. There will be several rounds each with different rules and a different waveform. The rounds will be timed, and at the end of each round, the judges will determine which team drew the better waveform.
\singlespace

\vspace{5mm}

\underline{\textit{Directions:}}
\ben
	\item{Divide into two teams of equal size.}
	\item{Each team should divide into pairs of students. Each pair will play one round.}
	\item{Each pair should pick an artist and a speaker. The speaker will describe the waveform to the artist, and the artist will draw what the speaker is describing.}
	\item{The artists from each team should go up to their respective board at the beginning of each round. When the judges say begin, the speaker should start describing the waveform. The artist is not allowed to talk or ask the speaker any questions. Remember, the speakers must follow any additional rules for each round!}
	\item{Stop drawing when the judges say time is up. The judges will then project the actual waveform onto each board and decide which team won the round.}
